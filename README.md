This project is to provide a library that can be used to support ABAC (Attribute Based Access Control) in a Java 
application. The library will provide the ability to allow user to define policies and use the library to evaluate 
them against a set of attributes.

It is intended to support multiple web frameworks via adapters. The adapters will be released in separate modules to
make the release number consistent with the target framework.
